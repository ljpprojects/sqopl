# SQOPL

SQOPL, or **S**imple **Q**uadruplicate **O**utvying **P**edestrian **L**anguage, is a simple, quadruplicate, outvying, pedestrian
language, as evidenced by its name. It is quadruplicate for its four core principles: Simplcity, Safety, Functionality,and Familiarity.
It is outvying because I want to make it better than other programming languages, and is pedestrian in the sense that it is quite dull.
